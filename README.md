# R-Code
An example of the R language code I used to complete my MSc Paper. 
My MSc project involved gathering and analysing data on the habitat availability and dispersion of the Mountain Bongo (Antelope). The code was used to analyse and present my data. The code below actions a statistical analysis (Random Forest) of the data and then subsequent graphing of the results.
